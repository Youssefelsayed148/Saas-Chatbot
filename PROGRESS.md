# Execution checkpoint

2026-10-12 — ADR-003 and P1-01 explicitly approved by product owner.

## 2026-10-12 — PHASE P2 complete (P2-00 → P2-04): knowledge ingestion, queue/worker, publish/rollback, Knowledge UI

IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED; evidence: [PHASE-02 report](implementation/PHASE-02/PHASE-REPORT.md) and per-ticket reports P2-00…P2-04 in `implementation/PHASE-02/`. All P2 checklist items ticked with evidence; STOPPED FOR OWNER SIGN-OFF.

- P2-00 carry-overs: security headers in `apps/web/next.config.ts` (Referrer-Policy no-referrer, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, CSP frame-ancestors 'none') proven by a Playwright test + live curl through the Compose stack; invitation double-accept race test added with a `FOR UPDATE` row-lock fix (exactly one 200, one 409, one membership, one audit row).
- P2-01: migration `0002_knowledge` (sources, source_pages, documents, knowledge_revisions with partial draft/published uniques, chunks with generated GIN `fts_en`/`fts_simple`, jobs; `bots.published_revision_id`; composite FKs; no vector/pgvector). DB queue with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED claim, lease reclaim, exponential backoff, cancel; `python -m app.worker`; Compose `worker` service (healthy, heartbeat healthcheck, shared `/data/storage`); `WORKER_ALLOW_ONLY_TEST_DB` guard verified; Playwright harness boots a real worker.
- P2-02: multipart upload with streaming 10 MB cap, ≤20 files, magic-byte sniffing (PDF/zip-docx/text), mislabelled/binary/oversize/zip-bomb guards; local-disk shared storage with generated tenant/bot keys (Windows `O_BINARY` fix validated); PDF/DOCX/TXT/MD parsers incl. Arabic and YAML front matter (http(s)-only `source_url`); Q&A CSV template + per-row report; chunker per docs/14 §4 (no content loss); language detector + Arabic normalisation §2; parse in worker with timeout. Pinned `pypdf==6.20.1`, `python-docx==1.2.0`, `PyYAML==6.0.3`, `python-multipart==0.0.32` (+dev `types-PyYAML`) in pyproject and both lockfiles.
- P2-02 proxy: Next 16 `experimental.proxyClientMaxBodySize: "220mb"` + `apps/web/proxy.ts` content-length guard; oversize upload (10 MB+1) rejected with 413 through the same-origin proxy with nothing stored (Playwright).
- P2-03: ingest job writes into a fresh draft revision that snapshots the published revision; content-hash dedupe; unchanged re-ingest is a no-op; publish/rollback = ordered atomic pointer swap (demote → promote → pointer, validated unique-index-safe); failed job never touches published knowledge; two tenants with identical content share zero rows (disjoint ids + referential check).
- P2-04: Knowledge page at `/app/[tenant]/bots/[botId]/knowledge` (upload + template link, files with Q&A row report, job list with Retry/Cancel and live polling, documents/chunks preview with source_url and RTL, revisions with Publish/Rollback, viewer read-only with zero write controls); Playwright 9 passed on the real stack (real API + real worker harness).
- Final checks (both toolchains): ruff clean, 83 files formatted, mypy strict 71 sources clean, pytest **123 passed** (Linux container + Windows venv), web format/lint/typecheck clean, `docker compose up --build -d --wait` all four services healthy, live curl smoke through port 3000 passed end to end (upload → worker `succeeded` → publish 200) and security headers present on `/` and `/login`.
- Carried limitations recorded in the P2 report: hosted CI never run; P1 in-process login rate limiter; proxy headers not attached to `/api` rewrites (the production gateway adds them); parse-timeout thread cannot be hard-killed (bounds documented); worker throughput is one job at a time per process; chunked (no Content-Length) bodies skip the proxy header check (the API streaming cap still applies).

Commands and detailed evidence per command live in the ticket reports. Local commits made per ticket (no push). Compose stack left running on loopback 3000/8000/55432 for owner review.

## 2026-10-12 — P1-02 implemented (schema + auth)

IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED; evidence: [P1-02 report](implementation/PHASE-01/P1-02-REPORT.md). Checklist P1-02 items ticked with that evidence.

- Alembic revision 0001_initial: users (citext email), sessions, tenants, memberships, bots, invitations, audit_events; UUID PKs; (tenant_id,id) anchor unique on bots; citext extension created/dropped by the migration.
- Auth: register/login/logout/me; Argon2id (argon2-cffi); server-side sessions (HttpOnly SameSite=Lax cookie; SHA-256 token hash stored); rotation on login; CSRF double-submit on cookie writes; login rate limit (in-process, 10/300s default); stable `{error:{code,message,request_id}}` everywhere; secrets never echoed.
- Tests: 40 passed on Windows host and in the Linux checks container against disposable DBs (`chatbot_dev_test`, `chatbot_dev_migration_test`); `_test`-guard unit test; migration up/down on an empty disposable DB; constraint tests; session lifecycle; CSRF; rate limit; duplicate email (case-insensitive).
- Exact commands and outcomes recorded in P1-02-REPORT.md: ruff/mypy/pytest clean; `alembic upgrade head` applied to dev `chatbot_dev`; live uvicorn smoke register→login→logout→401 verified with curl.
- Note: hosted CI still not run (no push authorization). Login limiter is single-process by design for P1.

Next: P1-03 (tenants, roles, bots, team invitations).

## 2026-10-12 — P1-03 implemented (tenants, roles, bots, team invitations)

IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED; evidence: [P1-03 report](implementation/PHASE-01/P1-03-REPORT.md). Checklist P1-03 items ticked with that evidence.

- Reusable TenantContext dependency resolves tenant from path, validates active membership, role-required helpers; hidden resources always 404.
- Tenants create (creator-owner, audited, unique slug), member-only tenant get; /me with memberships.
- Team: invitations via one-time link (SHA-256 hash stored, token shown once), accept with email match, expiry/revoke/resend; members list/role change/remove; last-owner + owner protections; all audited.
- Bots CRUD with validated config schema (docs/04 fields), soft archive (idempotent, config preserved, hidden from default list), tenant-scoped 404s; CSRF required on all writes; stable error codes.
- Tests: 61 passed — full role matrix, tenant A/B guessed-UUID isolation across bots/members/invitations, invitation lifecycle incl. expired/used/revoked/resend + stale token, last-owner protection, soft-archive behaviour, audits. Same result in the Linux checks container (docker run).
- Exact commands recorded in P1-03-REPORT.md.

## 2026-10-12 — P1-04 implemented (dashboard UI + Playwright E2E)

IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED; evidence: [P1-04 report](implementation/PHASE-01/P1-04-REPORT.md). P1-04 checklist items ticked with that evidence.

- Next.js dashboard pages: /register, /login, /app (org selector + create), /app/[tenant]/bots, /app/[tenant]/bots/[id]/settings (rename + validated config + archive), /app/[tenant]/settings/members (invite link shown once with copy, resend/revoke, role selects, remove, owner protection notes) and /accept-invite with return-path handling.
- Typed API client with same-origin rewrites proxy (no CORS), CSRF header automation, stable ApiError mapping, session-expired redirect (event-based, open-redirect-safe), role-aware controls, loading/empty/error states everywhere; no mocked data.
- Playwright: global setup boots the REAL FastAPI on a disposable chatbot_dev_e2e_test DB (alembic migrations; _test guard), 5 tests pass — register→org→bot→archive, second-user cross-tenant 404 surfacing, team invite/accept/editor rights, sign-out redirect, landing smoke.
- Web checks green (lint, format, typecheck, Playwright 5 passed); backend regression green (ruff/format/mypy strict/pytest 61 passed); Compose stack rebuilt healthy with the API proxy build arg; proxied register→me smoke 201/200 through the web origin.
- Exact commands recorded in P1-04-REPORT.md.

## 2026-10-12 — P1 phase complete: awaiting owner sign-off

PHASE-REPORT written (implementation/PHASE-01/PHASE-REPORT.md). All P1 checklist items ticked with evidence except the final owner sign-off line. Nothing pushed, merged or deployed; hosted CI still unrun (documented limitation). Local Compose is running for review on loopback 3000/8000/55432.

STOP — awaiting owner sign-off before P2.

P1-01: IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED; awaiting owner acceptance. Evidence: [P1-01 report](implementation/PHASE-01/P1-01-REPORT.md).

- Initialized Git on feat/p1-01-foundation; original handoff retained. No commits/remote/push/merge/deployment.
- Next.js 16.4.0 / React 19.3.0 / TypeScript 6.0.3; FastAPI 0.143.0 / Pydantic 2.14.1; PostgreSQL 17.11 with pgvector 0.8.7 available. No application schema or extension installation.
- Frontend Prettier/ESLint/typecheck passed. Final Playwright run: 1 passed (27.7s).
- Linux backend checks: Ruff lint/format passed, strict mypy passed for 9 files, pytest 6 passed with one httpx deprecation warning. Windows pytest also passed; Windows mypy blocked by Application Control and verified via Linux instead.
- Final Compose build/start succeeded; db/api/web healthy. Live smoke: API /health and /ready 200; frontend 200 and 8 static assets served.
- Failure test: stopped only local development DB; /health stayed 200, /ready safely returned 503; DB restored and readiness passed.
- Host Next.js dev and Uvicorn reload commands started and served expected responses; temporary processes stopped. Compose remains running locally on loopback 3000/8000/55432.
- Production npm audit: zero vulnerabilities. Development lint chain: five high entries from one unpatched braces advisory; tracked in report, tooling excluded from standalone runtime.
- GitHub Actions configured; hosted CI NOT RUN because no remote push is authorized.

All P1-02 through P1-09 tickets remain NOT STARTED. No authentication, tenant schema, bots, ingestion, RAG, widgets, billing, ManyOsirisChat integration or reference code was implemented/imported. Phase 1 as a whole is not complete.

Next action: owner reviews P1-01 evidence. P1-02 requires separate explicit approval and relevant schema/isolation decisions. Stop here.

## 2026-10-12 — Plan simplified (docs only, no code change)
Roadmap reduced to 5 vertical-slice phases; ADR-004/009/010/011/012 approved; ADR-005 later resolved (see below). Added docs/18-EXPECTED-BEHAVIOUR.md, implementation/PHASE-CHECKLISTS.md, implementation/AGENT-PROMPTS.md; rewrote roadmap, Phase 1 spec/register, reuse matrix, architecture, AGENTS.md, README_START_HERE.md. P1-01 committed locally. Next: P1-02 (paste prompt 1 from AGENT-PROMPTS.md).

## 2026-10-12 — Reference repos removed from the plan
No Retrivo/Rabbit Hole inspection step in the build. Retrieval/ingestion/analytics specs are agreed with the owner and recorded in docs/14-AGREED-BUILD-SPECS.md (all TBD for now). ADR-012 retired.

## 2026-10-12 — Design review of Rabbit Hole and Retrivo
Both repos were read together with the owner. Result recorded in docs/14-AGREED-BUILD-SPECS.md: keyword-first retrieval (ADR-005 resolved), free-model chain with OpenAI for paid plans (ADR-013), same-language-first retrieval (ADR-014), static HTML URL import (ADR-006 partly). P2 reduced to 5 tickets without embeddings; P3-06 semantic upgrade is optional and eval-gated. No code changed.

## 2026-10-12 — In-app scraper replaced by staff skill
ADR-006 resolved: no in-app crawler in MVP; website content comes from the website-to-knowledge skill (docs/14 §13) as Markdown pages with source URLs + Q&A CSV. P2 is now 4 tickets. No code changed.

## 2026-10-12 — Re-scoped as a Mojeeb-style website product
Owner clarified: this SaaS serves website clients; ManyOsirisChat provides the Meta connections. Roadmap is now 7 phases (P5 inbox/handoff/CRM, P6 ManyOsirisChat channel contract, P7 platform/quotas/hardening); ADR-002 revised, ADR-015/016/017 added; docs/14 gained §14–§18; docs/17 rewritten as the channel contract; checklists, prompts and expected-behaviour guide updated. First sellable cut = end of P5. No code changed. Next: P1-02 (prompt 1 in AGENT-PROMPTS.md).

## 2026-10-12 — Two dashboards (ADR-018)
Client dashboard per chatbot (docs/10) and platform admin console (docs/11) are now named deliverables. Basic admin console + staff onboarding moved into P4 (new ticket P4-06); P7-01/P7-03 narrowed to advanced operations and self-service hardening. Roadmap, checklists, prompts, API routes, FRs and behaviour guide updated. No code changed.
