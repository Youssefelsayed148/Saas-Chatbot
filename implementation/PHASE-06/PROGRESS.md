# Phase 6 progress

## P6-02 Stage A — event transport and inbound storage

- Added the signed Many event endpoint, bounded body reading, uniform authentication failures, rate limiting, idempotent event persistence, and atomic `channel_inbound` enqueueing.
- Added idempotent inbound handlers for contact identity/conversation/message storage, message delivery status, and channel health status. `visitor_chat_turn` was not changed.
- Migration `0018_channel_inbound` expands the job type constraint and permits a channel contact without website email/phone; downgrade restores the prior constraints.
- New focused tests: `apps/api/tests/test_channel_events.py` — **8 passed**.
- Ruff on Stage A touched Python files: **passed**.
- Strict mypy on the six touched application modules with `--follow-imports=silent`: **passed**. Without that flag, imported `knowledge/ingest.py` reports existing Windows-only `os.setsid`, `os.killpg`, and `signal.SIGKILL` typing errors.

### P6-00 baseline after Stage A

Each file was run in a separate process with `TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@127.0.0.1:55462/phase6`, `-q -p no:cacheprovider`, and a worktree-local pytest basetemp. Results:

| File | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `test_conversations.py` | 13 passed |
| `test_conversations_view.py` | 5 passed |
| `test_inbox_list.py` | 5 passed |
| `test_group_0_inbox.py` | 16 passed |
| `test_contacts.py` | 1 passed |
| `test_analytics.py` | 6 passed |
| `test_quotas.py` | 12 passed |
| `test_tenant_route_matrix.py` | 7 passed |
| `test_platform.py` | 9 passed |
| `test_platform_ops.py` | 4 passed |
| `test_create_platform_staff.py` | 2 passed |
| `test_widget_public.py` | 14 passed |
| `test_widget_leads.py` | 5 passed |
| `test_widget_appearance.py` | 3 passed |

Total: **102 passed**. The first sandbox-restricted attempt could not create pytest temporary fixture directories; the verified rerun enabled fixture writes in the phase worktree. No existing website tests or fixtures were edited.
